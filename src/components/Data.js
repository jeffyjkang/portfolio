      "It was a pleasure being in Jeff's PM group for front-end and back-end at Lambda School. When I was stuck on a problem, Jeff was able to help me debug and solve it. Especially while learning React, with Jeff hands on approach of explaining code line by line, I was able to understand it at a core level. This helped me with projects that was assigned each day and pass sprint challenges at the end of the week.",

      'Jeff was my Project Manager during my time as a student in the FSW14 portion of the curriculum at Lambda School.  During the three months that I spent as a member of his group, I have gotten to know Jeff and have always thought from the start that he was efficient, knowledgeable, caring, and approachable.  He always conducted our meetings on time, and appropriately, while also trying new things such as the implementation of interview-style mock whiteboard sessions which were incredibly helpful and beneficial for the ones I have done in technical interviews.  Because of his approach and conduct, I was inspired to become a PM myself, and with his encouragement and support was able to do so, and it was by far the best decision of my life and I am so grateful for his guidance and wisdom with regards to helping me with that goal.  Overall, Jeff is a dedicated, talented, and team-focused leader that can direct a team and inspire the members of that team to work with him and not for him.  He is the kind of person that you want to work with on a team and any company would gain an excellent, dedicated employee that can see beyond himself and inspire others to work towards the goals and desired outcomes for any development of engineering-based end product.',

      "To say that it is a blessing to have Jeff as a Project Manager would be an understatement, Jeff has been the single most important influence on my learning the world of Development. He's always there to help, class time or not, and always has the right advice to get me moving forward. Very thankful for the patience Jeff has shown to a struggling student like me. Jeff has an abundant wealth of knowledge pertaining to the class materials and the patience to manage 10+ struggling stressed out students.  Thanks again Jeff!",

      "I have known Jeffrey Kang since August of 2018, when I became a student at Lambda School. First, as my project manager and later, as a colleague in Lambda's capstone project section. Lambda is a fast-paced, dense curriculum and working with Jeffrey was relief. He was able to simplify lessons, astutely explain complicated programming concepts, review our daily assignments for accuracy and offer refactoring suggestions to help us write more concise code. Later, Jeffrey and I worked together on a 5-week project, FlyteLog, as a challenge to the skills we learned. At every level of development Jeffrey was at the forefront, planning, developing and refactoring. I know he spent many late nights working out bugs and implementing new features. Jeff's knowledge, patience and persistence were very important to my success as a student at Lambda and to the success of our capstone project. He is a diligent and hard-working person who I know would be a great addition at any business where he was hired.",
